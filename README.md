# 💳 Real-Time Payments Dashboard  
A live-streaming data dashboard built with **Python, Flask, WebSockets (Socket.IO), and Pandas**.  
Simulates high-frequency payment transactions — similar to what real fintech systems (like PayPay) process.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **real-time data pipeline** that generates synthetic transactions and streams them instantly to a live dashboard.

It showcases key skills used in modern Data Engineering:

- Real-time data ingestion  
- WebSocket-based streaming  
- Python backend development  
- Live data visualization  
- Event-driven architecture  
- Clean, modular code structure  

Perfect for roles involving **real-time payment monitoring, transaction pipelines, or data platform engineering**.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists
This dashboard simulates how a fintech platform (like **PayPay**, **LINE Pay**, etc.) might display **live payment events** flowing through the system.

It highlights:

- Realtime WebSocket events
- Continuous transaction generation
- Stateful data storage with Pandas
- Fast, lightweight Python server with Flask + SocketIO
